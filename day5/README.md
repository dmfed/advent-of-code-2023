I implemented this task both in Python ang Go because brute-force solution was too slow in Python. 

The code in both languages is very similar. But Go version solved the problem in 3 minutes and 24 seconds while Python version worked for as long as 5 hours 49 minutes 30 seconds. Both versions are single threaded.
